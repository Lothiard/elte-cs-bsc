# elte-cs-bsc

Here is my collection of code snippets and papers from my CS degree at ELTE, Modeler specialization (the one with all the math)
 
The initial idea was to just dump every file from uni to here to make my GitHub calendar look like I have aura, but it grew on me to the point where I lowkey care if people find it useful or not

If you feel like anything is missing, put a PR on it—that would make me feel really important
